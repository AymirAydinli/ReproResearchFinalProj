## Career Shot Chart by Season

Most players have their favorite spots on the court to shoot from â€“ areas where they are most comfortable and confident in making shots. These statistics are available to us to see in the form of shot charts. While box scores count the number of makes and misses throughout the game, shot charts take it a step further by tracking the location of each shot.With that information, fans and analysts can pinpoint where players and teams are most effective with their shots.

Data Source for this part is NBA API.
